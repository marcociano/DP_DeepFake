# DeepFake: Evidence Tracking and Evaluation for Content Trasparency
<p>The aim of this project is to develop an automatic system to identifyimages generated by various artificial intelligence modelswithin the ArtiFact dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/artifact-dataset.
To achieve this goal, we employed a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) to leverage its Few-Shot Learning capability.
This capacity enhances the systemâ€™s performance on images that were not seen during the training phase.</p>
